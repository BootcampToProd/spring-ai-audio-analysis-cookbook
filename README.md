# ðŸŽµ Spring AI Audio Analysis: A Developer's Guide to Transcription and Insights

This repository demonstrates how to build a comprehensive multimodal AI audio analysis API using Spring AI and Google Gemini 2.0. The application can process audio from multiple sources (file uploads, URLs, Base64, classpath) and provide intelligent insights by combining text prompts with audio analysis. This project showcases the power of multimodal AI that processes both text and audio simultaneously, enabling transcription, sentiment analysis, speaker identification, and content summarization.

## ðŸ’¡ About This Project

This project implements a **comprehensive Audio Analysis API** to demonstrate the power of multimodal AI with Spring AI. It showcases how to:

*   Process audio from 4 different input sources: classpath resources, file uploads, web URLs, and Base64 strings.
*   Configure Spring AI to work with Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash through OpenAI-compatible endpoints.
*   Build REST API with proper error handling and validation.
*   Combine text prompts with audio content for intelligent, context-aware responses.

The application exposes four REST endpoints that accept audio files in different formats along with text prompts, sends them to Gemini for multimodal analysis, and returns AI-generated insights about the audio content including transcription, sentiment analysis, and content summarization.
